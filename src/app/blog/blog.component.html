          I’m writing this today since I know that if I wait I’ll just avoid work tomorrow and write a much longer post. We don’t need
          another one of these, but I hope this blog and website take off this year – so I’ll chip in.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two arguments against unlimited acquisitions that I think are legitimate and need to be addressed. The first is
          time – making moves and staying competitive with unlimited acquisitions takes time every day. The second is strategy
          – unlimited acquisitions can be painted as a safe harbor for those with weaker death lineups.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s worth noting that these two points can’t coexist. You’ll either have your time or you’ll have strategy. With an acquisition
          limit, championship management will still require that you check on your team every day and plan your next moves
          carefully – to Brett and other’s point, this may take even more time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s also not pretend like acquisitions = a lack of strategy. You purposely draft high upside players with the knowledge
          that you can drop them if they don’t pan out. Siakam, Osman, Brogdon, Fox on my squad. Most folks probably should
          and do have more. Corey drops half his team after day one every year. But which players to drop? Some high upside
          players require patience that you can’t/won’t give them – multiple people, myself included, dropped Tyreke Evans
          at the beginning of last year. Do I drop Ariza now? Who has Boban right now? Are you dropping him for a spot start?
          Tough calls that you have to make over and over again throughout the season. How valuable are your roster spots?
          Do you hold a player who has a back-to-back Sat-Sun for a spot start on Thursday? Or do you go full rowdy and carry
          a full roster every day? I don’t have to explain this to you guys – you know the drill. Historically, Colin has
          killed us by making very few acquisitions. I, admittedly, tend to be on the other end of the spectrum. If any of
          you want to stack your roster with more ‘undroppables’ then I will gladly trade you two high-tier guys for one
          of your studs. I, personally, am glad for the excuse to interact with this league and you assholes every day for
          a decent chunk of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only way the time and strategy arguments can coexist is if we move to zero acquisitions. I know Brett is on record as
          preferring no acquisitions to unlimited acquisitions – Brett, I admire your commitment to the cause, but I suspect
          your supporters are tainted by unrowdiness. Those that don’t want to give this league the time that they once did.
          I don’t want this league to slip towards a “normal” fantasy basketball league. Regardless of how you define “Rowdy,”
          it’s those differences that have made this league great from day 1 (I assume – I wasn’t there). I’ll spare you
          more theatrics and simply defer to Dan’s writeup on that point – I wholeheartedly agree. On a related note, let’s
          reintroduce ejections and techs next year.

          Okay, so the first thing I need to do is address some of the arguments made here that I don’t think hold up. First and foremost,
          if your definition of rowdy includes “acquisitions”, it needs to be asked if you’re even rowdy in the first place.
          Unlimited acquisitions is in the same rowdiness tier as using your friend’s Netflix account, rolling through stop
          signs, and getting a shot of espresso in your coffee because you “like to party”. </p>
        <p>
          I do agree that the ability to find effective free agents is something that indicates great owners. However, having unlimited
          drop/adds makes those finds less impressive because you can just throw a bunch of guys out there and hope you strike
          gold. In some cases (I’m not saying all), unlimited adds lets some good owners masquerade as great owners. Having
          a limit requires more skill and planning because you have to be efficient with your adds and you have to utilize
          them at the right time.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as drafting with unlimited acquisitions in mind, I guess I just don’t know what that means. Does that mean you drafted
          lesser players on purpose? That seems very unlikely. Everybody drafted players to play the first week then drop.
          With an acquisition limit there will still be 5-6 players on your roster that are dispensible (compared to 5-6
          "roster players" with unlimited acquisitions). Also, the argument that this change needs time to be implemented
          falls flat to me. It’s just a few clicks away.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t want to take much more of your time. I just want to say this. Fantasy basketball should be about good players vs.
          good players. If your death squad beats my death squad, then you deserve the win. If you killed your draft, you
          should be rewarded for that. However, unlimited adds is allowing lesser teams to win by using a bunch of nobodies
          that, collectively, add up to somebody. You should win because you have better players and pick up good free agents,
          not because you started 35 players to his 50.

          I am strongly against an acquisition limit. By limiting acquisitions, you limit a fundamental part of running your team.
          The decision of who to add and you to drop are what differentiate good owners from great owners. The ability to
          identify talent off the waiver wire is what separates the rowdy from the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the best parts of our league is that we take fantasy basketball seriously. This is a league that rewards smarts and
          instincts. By limiting acquisitions, you make our league average. Are we rowdy as shit? The league I once knew
          rewarded chaos! We got points for techs and ejections! Now, not only are we not embracing the chaos, we are adding
          a rule that will suck the energy out of this place. I don’t want rowdy to become the rules as shit league. That’s
          not to say that we don’t have rules, however, every rule change that we have made so far (keepers, salary caps,
          expanded rosters, etc...)rewards good owners. This rule would punish good ownership. If this rule must be implemented,
          I ask that it happen next year. I drafted my team with a strategy based on having unlimited waiver wire moves.
          A change this big needs time to be implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
          In closing, life is a game of inches. So is fantasy basketball. One Marco Belinelli drop and you don’t win the day... one
          Mike Muscala add and you lose the week. Leaving a roster spot open for Tomas Satoransky means you have to sacrifice
          Wesley Matthews. The inches we need are everywhere. The rowdy as shit league is strongest when it has owners that
          will scratch and claw and fight for that inch. Now I can’t make you do this. You’ve got to look at the owner next
          to you. Look at his roster. You are going to see owners who don’t want a dumbed down version of fantasy basketball.
          Now, we either keep this league the most rowdy as it’s ever been or we die with the rules. What are you going to
          do?
