          I am strongly against an acquisition limit. By limiting acquisitions, you limit a fundamental part of running
          your team. The decision of who to add and you to drop are what differentiate good owners from great owners.
          The ability to identify talent off the waiver wire is what separates the rowdy from the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the best
          parts of our league is that we take fantasy basketball seriously. This is a league that rewards smarts and
          instincts. By limiting acquisitions, you make our league average. Are we rowdy as shit? The league I once
          knew rewarded chaos! We got points for techs and ejections! Now, not only are we not embracing the chaos, we
          are adding a rule that will suck the energy out of this place. I don’t want rowdy to become the rules as shit
          league. That’s not to say that we don’t have rules, however, every rule change that we have made so far
          (keepers, salary caps, expanded rosters, etc...)rewards good owners. This rule would punish good ownership.
          If this rule must be implemented, I ask that it happen next year. I drafted my team with a strategy based on
          having unlimited waiver wire moves. A change this big needs time to be implemented.
        </p>

          In closing, life is a game of inches. So is fantasy basketball. One Marco Belinelli drop and you don’t win
          the day... one Mike Muscala add and you lose the week. Leaving a roster spot open for Tomas Satoransky means
          you have to sacrifice Wesley Matthews. The inches we need are everywhere. The rowdy as shit league is
          strongest when it has owners that will scratch and claw and fight for that inch. Now I can’t make you do
          this. You’ve got to look at the owner next to you. Look at his roster. You are going to see owners who don’t
          want a dumbed down version of fantasy basketball. Now, we either keep this league the most rowdy as it’s ever
          been or we die with the rules. What are you going to do?
